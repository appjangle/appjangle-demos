		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<p>The previous 10 demos showcase various capabilities of the
			Appjangle platform. In particular, we have explored the iterative
			development of a simple application 'The Wall of the Wise'.</p>
		<p>While this application is by no means complete as yet, we can
			say with confidence that we have assembled a fairly substantial
			prototype thus far.</p>
		<p>In this conclusion, we would like to highlighted a number of
			benefits from using the Appjangle platform, which are illustrated by
			the demos. Please find these benefits listed below.</p>

		<h5>No Database Configuration and Server Code</h5>
		<p>While our application persists data in the cloud and supports
			the synchronization between multiple users, we did not have to write
			a single line of classical 'server' code.</p>

		<h5>Smooth Cross-Platform Development</h5>
		<p>
			In <a href="#javaClient">demo 09</a>, we could easily implement a
			Java client for our previously JavaScript-only application.
		</p>
		<p>For this, we could ignore the fact that we are accessing data
			created in a JavaScript environment. All data type mapping/data
			conversion/etc is silently taken care of in the background and we can
			focus on building the application logic we are about.</p>


		<h5>Concise Database Logic</h5>
		<p>Although our clients are not mere 'UI wrappers' of the required
			functionality but embed the entire app features, the logic to
			interact with the database is concise an limited to a couple of lines
			of code.</p>
		<p>
			For instance, the most advanced version of the application to make
			posts to the wall <a
				href="https://github.com/appjangle/appjangle-demos/blob/master/src/main/js/demo06_add_authorization.js">demo06_add_authorization.js</a>
			contains only 30 lines of code, which contain references to the
			Nextweb API.
		</p>


		<h5>Easy Data Structure Extensability and Evolveability</h5>
		<p>
			Starting with a very simple model developed in <a href="#salve">demo
				01</a>, we have evolved the data model of our application in small
			incremental steps:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Demo 02 added a data type 'aPost' to identify posts.</li>
			<li>Demo 05 added the data types 'anAvatar' and 'aUserName'.</li>
			<li>Demo 06 added a data type 'aRemarkablePost'.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All these changes did not affect the 'backward compatibility'
			of the data stored by our server. For instance, a wall created with
			demo 06 could without problems be loaded by the client in demo 05.</p>

		<h5>High Modularity</h5>
		<p>We have created the more complex demos out of a number loosely
			coupled modules. Demo 07, for instance, consists of the following
			modules:</p>
		<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
			<tr>
				<th>Module</th>
				<th>Script</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Spawn</td>
				<td><a
					href="https://github.com/appjangle/appjangle-demos/blob/master/src/main/js/demo07_spawn.js">demo07_spawn.js</a></td>
				<td>To start clients apps and moderator app.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Login</td>
				<td><a
					href="https://github.com/appjangle/appjangle-demos/blob/master/src/main/js/demo07_login.js">demo07_login.js</a></td>
				<td>To register or sign in using email address and password.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Wall</td>
				<td><a
					href="https://github.com/appjangle/appjangle-demos/blob/master/src/main/js/demo06_add_authorization.js">demo06_add_authorization.js</a></td>
				<td>To make posts to the Wall of the Wise.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Moderator</td>
				<td><a
					href="https://github.com/appjangle/appjangle-demos/blob/master/src/main/js/demo06_moderation_app.js">demo06_moderation_app.js</a></td>
				<td>To highlight posts as remarkable.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			As can be seen, from the used JavaScript files, this <a
				href="#userManagement">demo 07</a> reuses modules from <a
				href="#fineGrainedSharing">demo 06</a>. Moreover, most of the
			modules used in demo 07 are in turn used by <a href="#security">demo
				08</a> as well.
		</p>
		<p>The only dependency these demos share is the application data
			stored in the Appjangle cloud. There are no direct source code
			dependencies between the modules, which allows to easily compose and
			recombine the modules to react to evolving requirements.</p>

		<h5>Rapid Application Evolution</h5>
		<p>From the very simple text-only prototype developed in demo 01,
			we were able to rapidly extend the functionality of our application
			by drawing on the ready-made building blocks, the Appjangle platform
			provided.</p>
		<p>For instance, the following key steps in the development of our
			application usually require significant resources to be implemented:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>From <a href="#instantData">demo 03</a> to <a
				href="#transparentCloudPersistence">demo 04</a>, we changed only a
				couple of lines of code, yet our application was transformed from a
				JavaScript-only client-based application to an application which
				persists its state in a centralized database.
			</li>
			<li>From <a href="#transparentCloudPersistence">demo 04</a> to <a
				href="#stateSynchronization">demo 05</a>, we allowed our application
				to be 'collaborative' in that multiple users are enabled to see each
				others actions.
			</li>
			<li>From <a href="#fineGrainedSharing">demo 06</a> to <a
				href="#userManagement">demo 07</a>, we added a 'traditional' user
				registration and login dialog. We could accomplish this by reusing
				the Appjangle user management facilities and could leave the logic
				of our main application unaltered.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These steps are not only notable due to velocity in which they
			could be accomplished but also because they solve 'hard' problems,
			which can easily 'make or break' an application. For instance,
			turning a client-only prototype into an application, which draws its
			data from a central database and does so with acceptable performance,
			can take up the majority of development time. In Appjangle, we get
			this feature virtually for free.</p>
		<h5>The Platform for Smarter Apps</h5>
		<p>While using Appjangle provided us with numerous benefits listed
			above, the most significant advantages can be drawn by the unique
			combination of all these benefits.</p>
		<p>
			While not needing to implement a server, building easily for
			multiple-platforms, expressing database logic concisely in few lines
			of code, and utilizing the powerful building blocks of the Appjangle
			platform allow us to build application <b>rapidly</b>, the easy and
			flexible extension of data structures and intrinsic high modularity
			give even quickly built application <b>sustainable value</b>; in that
			they are easy to maintain, recombine and extend.

		<p>Please try out Appjangle for yourself and let us know what you
			think!</p>
