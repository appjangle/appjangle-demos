		<h4>Conclusion: Smooth Agility</h4>
		<p>The previous 10 demos showcase various capabilities of the
			Appjangle platform. In particular, we have explored the iterative
			development of a simple application 'The Wall of the Wise'.</p>
		<p>While this application is by no means complete as yet, we can
			say with confidence that we have assembled a fairly substantial
			prototype thus far.</p>
		<p>In this conclusion, we would like to highlighted a number of
			benefits from using the Appjangle platform, which are illustrated by
			the demos. Please find these benefits listed below.</p>
		<h5>No Database Configuration and Server Code</h5>
		<p>While our application persists data in the cloud and supports
			the synchronization between multiple users, we did not have to write
			a single line of classical 'server' code.</p>
		<h5>Concise Database Logic</h5>
		<p>Although our clients are not mere 'UI wrappers' of the required
			functionality but embed the entire app features, the logic to
			interact with the database is concise an limited to a couple of lines
			of code.</p>
		<p>
			For instance, the most advanced version of the application to make
			posts to the wall <a
				href="https://github.com/appjangle/appjangle-demos/blob/master/src/main/js/demo06_add_authorization.js">demo06_add_authorization.js</a>
			contains only 30 lines of code, which contain a reference to the
			Nextweb API.
