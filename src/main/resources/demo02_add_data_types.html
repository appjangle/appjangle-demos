		<h5>Requirements</h5>
		<p>
			The first data model we have designed in <a href="#salve">demo 01</a>
			certainly leaves much to be desired. In this demo, we introduce a few
			simple data types for our model to make the data of our application
			more meaningful.

		<h5>Data Model</h5>
		<p>
			In order to make the data of the Wall of the Wise application more
			meaningful, we can utilize a simple HyperData design pattern: <a
				href="http://nextweb.io/docs/nextweb-data-pattern.value.html#property">the
				hyperdata property</a>. These properties allow to enrich simple untyped
			graphs with meaningful data types.
		</p>
		<p>In simple terms, a hyperdata property consists of three nodes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>target node</em>: this is the node for which the
				property is to be defined.
			<li><em>property value node</em>: this node carries the value of
				the property.
			<li><em>property type node</em>: this node represents the type
				of the property.
		</ul>
		<p>
			For our Wall of the Wise we define a property 'a post', which helps
			us to identify posts to our wall to other data items. For the model
			build in <a href="#salve">demo 01</a>, the resulting model with types
			could be defined as follows:

				<em>Figure: Data model with types</em>
			</p>
		</div>
		<h5>Upload Data Types</h5>
		<p>
			In the model, we use the data type <em>aPost</em>. In order to use
			this data type, we first need to create it. Luckily, this is very
			easy, since the property pattern allows any arbitrary node to serve
			as a type node and creating nodes is what Appjangle does best!
		</p>
		<p>The following script creates a new data type node 'aPost' and
			prints out the address for this data type. By copying this address,
