		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>
			In the beginning, there was the idea: How awesome would a
			social-network-kinda-thing be where you are not yourself but some
			kick-ass historic figure? Very awesome, of course <i
				class="icon-thumbs-up"></i>!
		<p>So let's get down to business and get that coding part done in
			order to have a masquerade release party with minimal delay!</p>
		<p>
			The following demos illustrate a number of steps we could undertake
			to implement our idea using Appjangle. These demos are also meant to
			demonstrate the benefits we claim on our <a
				href="http://appjangle.com/about">about</a> page. Please click on
			the links below to open the various demos or use the navigation on
			the left. We recommend going through the demos in the sequence they
			are provided here.
