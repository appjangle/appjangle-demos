		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>In the beginning, there was the idea: How awesome would a
			social-network-kinda-thing be where you are not yourself but some
			kick-ass historic figure?</p>
		<p>
			Very awesome, of course! <i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i> <i
				class="icon-thumbs-up"></i> <i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i>
		<p>So let's get down to business and get that coding part done so
			that we can have a masquerade release party with minimal delay!</p>
		<p>
			The following demos illustrate a number of steps we could undertake
			to implement our idea using Appjangle. These demos are also meant to
			demonstrate the benefits we claim on our <a
				href="http://appjangle.com/about">about</a> page.
		</p>
		<p>Please click on the links below to open the various demos or
			use the navigation on the left. We recommend going through the demos
			in the sequence they are provided here.</p>

		<p>Just playing around with Appjangle to get some data into the
			cloud (using JavaScript and Java).</p>

		<p>Adding data types to make it easier to work with the data we
